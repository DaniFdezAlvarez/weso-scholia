## Done

- A blazegraph SPARQL endpoint was set up with the authors subset of the country authors query as fuseki does not support blazegraph specific syntax. The authors subquery is run locally while the rest of the query is federated to wikidata. The resulkts are inconsistent. They do not match those of wikidata.
- Created a python generic script to execute the workflow of docker containers. This is needed to automate the dumps extraction and the performance tests.
- Got country_authors to work in Scholia for every country (2500 LIMIT). Also, tried setting up manually partial queries which go through (OFFSET) different sections of the subsetting and dump the results dinamically in one table, successfully.

## Tasks

- Execute the performance tests over blazegrpah.
- Write server baseline with regard to the performance tests results.
- Documment as a notebook the subset extraction, the local blazegraph endpint and the federate queries.Try to find out why the results are inconsistent. (Pablo)
- Automatize the Scholia partial querying so that the total number of rows is measured and as many queries as needed to go through the whole subsetting are performed dinamically.
