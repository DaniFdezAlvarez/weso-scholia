# Meeting 03-June-2021

## Attendees 

- Pablo
- Guillermo
- Jorge

## Done

- Dani indicates that in order to work with large files [Gogg](https://glogg.bonnefon.org/) is a great tool.
- Egon answered Pablo that we can use Blazegraph directly instead of Wikibase.
- Willy is working on ways to extract the BZ2 Wikidata dump.
- Jorge built and run the Docker corresponding to Scholia Selenium tests. They seem to run, problem is, they never seem to end, running the same tests over and over again.
- Jorge looked at Blazegraph SPARQL extensions. Most interestingly, INCLUDE not only may be used to pre-compute solution sets [within a query](https://github.com/blazegraph/database/wiki/NamedSubquery) -as seen in the examples- but use solution sets which have been made [durable or transient in cache](https://github.com/blazegraph/database/wiki/SPARQL_Update).
- [Document HDT research](https://github.com/weso/weso-scholia/issues/3)
