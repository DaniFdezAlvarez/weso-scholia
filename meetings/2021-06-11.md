## Done
- Investigate ways to transform the turtle dump to n-triples format.
- Downloaded the Wikidata dump in n-triples format.
- Extracted the n-triples wikidata dump.
- Created a job to split the ntriples file in multiple smaller files to allow parallel processing. 
- Rewrited country-authors query in order to try to perform federate queries from Fuseki. Federate queries donÂ´t work properly from Fuseki.
- SPARQL query testing now registers the number of nodes returned for every query, so that we can check 1) the potential relationship between size and response time and 2) the consistency of results.


## Tasks
- Automate the pipeline to download, extract transform and load the wikidata ntriples dump.
- Deploy a Blazegraph instance with the country-authors subset and try to make federate queries to wikidata.
- First approach to INCLUDE with stored solution sets in the deployed Blazegraph.
