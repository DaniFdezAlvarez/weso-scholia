## Done

- About Selenium Tests:
    - Some of the tests provided in the examples fail in an inconsistent manner -p.e., some runs report 14/20 failures, others 6/20-.
    - Timeouts always take place at the start.
    - The SCHOLIA_CONFIG environment variable, which allows us to set a configuration file in order to indicate the pages to test, doesn't seem to work. It always resorts to the [default value](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nunogit/scholia-junit-selenium/master/pages/smalltestset.csv), so we had to modify the code to try different test sets.
    - Tests seem to enter in a loop, with no end as far as was seen.
    - The [larger tests](https://github.com/nunogit/scholia-junit-selenium/blob/master/pages/pagetotest.csv) throws multiples exceptions and never end.
    - Wrong time measurements when testing queries ("Took -1 seconds" is a common response).

- Created a new Docker Job to download latest wikidata dump both in ttl and json. 
- Created a new Docker Job to extract a wikidata dump.



## Tasks
- Discuss with Labra and Dani about:
    - The problems with the Selenium tests
    - The dump extraction problems
- Ask for the next meeting.
