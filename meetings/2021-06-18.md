# Meeting 18-June-2021

## Attendees 

- Pablo
- Guillermo
- Jorge

## Done

- Executed the workload test on Blazegraph to estimate the size of the server.
- Created a new Scholia function capable of executing -at least- the country_authors query in all cases, by dividing the subsetting in small batches, so that the results are retrieved gradually and swiftly. See https://github.com/weso/weso-scholia/issues/8 for details.
- Created a [dump for luxembourg authors](https://wdumps.toolforge.org/dump/1479) using WDumper. Results are not the expected.


## Tasks
- Guillermo: Put the results of the workload tests together.
- Look for the cause (and desirably, a solution) of minor problems in the new paginated query (repeated rows, lack of expected figures -though the subsetting itself seems to blame...-)
- Document the subset extraction problems (Pablo)
