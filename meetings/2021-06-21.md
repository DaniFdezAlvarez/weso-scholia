# Meeting 21-June-2021

## Attendees 

- Pablo
- Jorge

## Done

- Fixed repetitions in the paginated queries. Applied it to country_organizations as well, with little effort and similar (satisfactory) results.


## Discussions
- There is a loss of entities for the created subset endpoint of the country-authors query beacause of the SequencePaths(https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#pp-language). WeÂ´re extracting only the final entities but not the intermediates. 

## Tasks
- Deploy Scholia with paginated queries prototype for showcasing purposes.
- Disscuss the subset problems with Labra and the others.
