## Done

- Executed tests and observed inconsistencies in the number of nodes returned, which I suspect are to blame in the stopping condition. 
- Tried some alternatives to restrict more the subsetting, which reduce the number of queries while upping the response time per query. Formal measurements yet to be done.
- Maintenance on the virtualization hosts used for the project.


## Tasks

- Execute tests again -final results were not dumped correctly- and modify the stop condition. If done correctly, and my suspicions are right, inconsistencies should be solved in the next iteration.
- Continue with the maintenance of the virtualization hosts.
- Document the subset proccess.
- Measure the new times with the subset.
