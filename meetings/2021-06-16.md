# Meeting 16-June-2021

## Attendees 

- Pablo
- Guillermo
- Jorge

## Done

- Guillermo: Created random RDF n-triples files for 100Mb, 200Mb... 100Gb.
- Worked on subquery subset extraction.
- Analysed response times for country_authors with different limits for the subsetting. P.e., "Spain" with 1000 LIMIT takes over a second. Possibility of dividing current unworking queries in multiple subqueries using small LIMITs and OFFSET.

## Tasks

- Guillermo: Load the files in Blazegraph one by one and measure the impact on the machine.
    - Try to infer the spects of a server to handle the Wikidata dumps.
- Get working country_authors queries for relevant countries in our Scholia, firstly using only a LIMIT.
- Pablo: Continue working on subsetting. Check results of federate queries from blazegraph.
