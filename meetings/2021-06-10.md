## Done
- Improved queries testing so that it reads from .sparql files, measures the response time of every query a number of times and exports the results to CSV. Such results include the calculation of the mean and the standard deviation corresponding to the set of times, as well as the longest and shortest time -for reference-.
- Tried to import the turtle data in Blazegraph but it complains that it needs an n-triples file.
- As in wikidata we can not perform federate queries to our local endpoint (there is a [limited set of allowed SPARQL endpoints for federated queries](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual/SPARQL_Federation_endpoints)) we tried to make the federate query from Fuseki to Wikidata, but Fuseki doesnÂ´t allow Blazegraph syntax futures.
- The "authors" inner query has been tested for both Wikidata and Fuseki (local) endpoints. The times improve significantly as you can see below:

| Endpoint/Execution (ms) | Execution 1 | Execution 2 | Execution 3 | Execution 4  |  Execution 5 | Average
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
| Wikidata     | 3249     | 2470     | 2320     | 2329     | 2279     |  2529,4 
| Local Fuseki     | 43     | 23     | 17     | 17     | 14     |  22,8     


## Tasks
- Download the n-triples dump from wikidata.
- Import the n-triples file in Blazegraph.
- Tests results should also indicate the number of nodes obtained in every query.
- Try to rewrite the "authors" query in SPARQL1.1 in order to try to make the federate query from fuseki.
