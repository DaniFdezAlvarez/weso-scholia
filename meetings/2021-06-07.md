# Meeting 07-June-2021

## Attendees 

- Pablo
- Guillermo
- Jorge

## Done
- Created VM with 2.0T of disk to work with the WD dump. The connection details will be emailed to the collaborators directly.

## Discussions
- After analysing the state of the available selenium tests, we reached as a conclusion that it will be more efficient to implement our own, focusing in the measurement of the performance of SPARQL queries of interest. With that goal in mind, we aim to use other testing frameworks which may provide a more straightforward approach, such as Cypress (JS).

## Tasks
- Create users for Pablo, Jorge and Dani in the work VM.
- Install Docker in the VM.
- Download and extract the wikidata dump in the shared directory of the VM.
- Automate some queries tests to see if the performance is increased.
