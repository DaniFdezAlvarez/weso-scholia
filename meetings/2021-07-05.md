## Done
- Dani's script finished and created all the chunks.
- Filtering COUNTRY_AUTHORS does produce a notable reducement of response times and results, but the stopping condition seems mainly to blame (it is ending before planned).
- Executed [wdumper](https://github.com/bennofs/wdumper) with the [scholia-filters](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/Scholia-wdumper). The dump we used was one from 2014 for a first approach.

## Tasks
- Create an script that loads the file in blazegraph.
- Download the lastest dump in json in order to try it with wdumper.
- Execute again the filtered query with a more permissive stopping condition.
- Keep documenting the findings.
