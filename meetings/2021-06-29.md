## Done
- Downloaded and decompressed the last ntriples dump.
- POC trying to load dump in blazegraph, error with blank nodes.
- Started documenting the subsetting process (https://github.com/weso/weso-scholia/issues/10)
- Measured times for ordered subsetting in partial queries and reached initial conclusions (not worth it).
- Documented such measurements in a new issue.

## Tasks
- Test if the problem with blazegraph comes from the blanck nodes starting with a number or all of them.
- Keep documenting the subsetting process.
- Measure subset times and compare it with the wikidata times.
- Create a new metric for tests which measures the number of _unique_ nodes returned, in order to determine the severity of the inconsistencies detected.
