## Done
- Simple performance measurement of queries from Java.
    - Example: country_authors produces a timeout with Spain, over 3s with a smaller country (Luxembourg)
    - organization_topics seems a good reference to measure improvements, as parametrized with "University of Oxford" it provides results in a 10-15 seconds window.
- Downloading JSON/Turtle in our local machine
- ShEx-s libraries now are published at Sonatype


## Discussions
- Strategy to refactor the original SPARQL queries step by step
    - 1.- Take an example SPARQL query (organization-topics...)
    - 2.- Develop a bot to automatically process the subquery results and store them in an auxiliar triple-store (the temporary results can be stored in different named graphs for each type of query)
    - 3.- Rewrite the SPARQL queries to replace the INCLUDE clauses and subqueries by SPARQL 1.1 federated invocations 
    - 4.- Once it works, another step could be to replace the SPARQL queries to use the wikidata subset (HDT dump or another auxiliary endpoint with wikidata subset dumps)
- Trying to guess how an example SPARQL query is composed: 
    - Example: [organization_topics.sparql](https://github.com/fnielsen/scholia/blob/master/scholia/app/templates/organization_topics.sparql)
    - [sparql_to_table macro](https://github.com/fnielsen/scholia/blob/ceafcbb2fd721117d3a4bc4ff63a9efd7d9a1589/scholia/app/templates/base.html#L3)
        - The macro takes the aspect (organization) and the panel (topics) and joins them to load the: aspect_panel.sparql query (see [organization.html](https://github.com/fnielsen/scholia/blob/master/scholia/app/templates/organization.html))

## Tasks
- Check whether the subqueries in WITH are repeated in different SPARQL queries (relevant to items 2 and 3 in discussions) (Jorge/Pablo)
- Start implementing wikidata subset feature (labra)
- Check Egon's issues (Guillermo)
- Improve performance tests and record results (Jorge/Pablo)
- Start implementing step 2 above (bot to generate partial results) (Jorge/Pablo)
