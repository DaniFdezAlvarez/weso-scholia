## Done
- Finally achieved to get a full subset of luxembourg authors and deploy it in a blazegraph endpoint.
- Extended tests so that paginated queries may be measured (response times, queries and nodes).


## Tasks
- Document all the process for the luxembourg authors subset.
- Add a couple relevant data for the tests output (first results time, shortest/longest subquery time...)
- Launch tests (time-costly)
